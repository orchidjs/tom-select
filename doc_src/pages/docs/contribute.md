### Pull Requests

1) **Include tests**

That's it. If you're motivated to fix a bug you've found or develop a new feature, we'd love to see it.
Including tests helps to demonstrate the functionality you're adding and are required before we'll merge your changes.


### Tests
Please ensure all the tests pass:

```shell
$ yarn test
```

### Local environment
Runing ```yarn start``` on your repo will start a web server allowing you to view a local copy of tom-select.js.org.

```shell
$ yarn start
```

Once started, you can run all the examples at `http://localhost:8000/`.
